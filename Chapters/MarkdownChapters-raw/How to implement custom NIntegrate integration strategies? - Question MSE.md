How can new integration strategies algorithms be used with `NIntegrate`? 

This is a different type of extension than the extensions with new integration rules, as described in [the answer](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/118326/34008) for the question ["How to implement custom integration rules for use by NIntegrate?"](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/118324/34008). (Integration strategies perform and guide the core integration process, using or leveraging different integration rules and/or preprocessing algorithms.)
