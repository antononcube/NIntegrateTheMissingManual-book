# NIntegrate, the missing manual

This repository is for code, book chapters, and project management files for the book "NIntegrate - the missing manual". 

The book aims to gather articles, explanations, and descriptions of undocumented or (very) advanced features and applications of Mathematica's function `NIntegrate`.

The book should be seen as complimentary to the book/monograph [1](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NIntegrateOverview.html).

I designed and implemented the new `NIntegrate` (included in Mathematica Version 6.0 and later) and wrote [1] while working at Wolfram Research Inc. (from 2001 to 2008.)

The raw documents are posts I made at my blog ["Mathematica for prediction"](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com), at [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com) and, mostly, at [Mathematica Stack Exchange (MSE)](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com). (I plan at some point to invite others to include their contributions from MSE in this repository.)
