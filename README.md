# NIntegrate - The Missing Manual

## In brief

This repository is for code, book chapters, and project management files for the book "NIntegrate - The Missing Manual". 

The book aims to gather and put in a certain coherent order 
articles, explanations, and descriptions of undocumented and (very) advanced features and applications of 
[Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)'s function 
[`NIntegrate`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NIntegrate.html).

The book should be seen as complimentary to the Wolfram Research Inc. (WRI) book/monograph \[[1](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NIntegrateOverview.html)\].

## Some details

I designed and implemented the new `NIntegrate` (included in Mathematica Version 6.0 and later) and wrote \[1\] in the years 2002-2007, while working at WRI. (I worked at WRI from 2001 to 2008.)

The raw documents in the repository are copies of posts I made at my blog
 ["Mathematica for prediction"](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com), 
 at 
 [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com),
 and, mostly, at 
 [Mathematica Stack Exchange (MSE)](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com). 
 (I plan at some point to invite others to include their contributions from MSE in this repository.)
 
 The Jupyter notebooks are included in order users/readers to be able to utilize 
 [the free Wolfram Engine for Developers](http://www.wolfram.com/engine/), [2],
 and the 
 [Wolfram Language kernel for Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter),  [3].
