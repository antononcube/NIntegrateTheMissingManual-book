# NIntegrate - The Missing Manual

This repository is for code, book chapters, and project management files for the book "NIntegrate - The Missing Manual". 

The book aims to gather articles, explanations, and descriptions of undocumented or (very) advanced features and applications of [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)'s function `NIntegrate` and put them in a certain coherent order.

The book should be seen as complimentary to the Wolfram Research Inc. (WRI) book/monograph \[[1](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NIntegrateOverview.html)\].

I designed and implemented the new `NIntegrate` (included in Mathematica Version 6.0 and later) and wrote \[1\] in the years 2002-2007, while working at WRI. (I worked at WRI from 2001 to 2008.)

The raw documents in repository are copies of posts I made at my blog ["Mathematica for prediction"](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com), at [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com) and, mostly, at [Mathematica Stack Exchange (MSE)](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com). (I plan at some point to invite others to include their contributions from MSE in this repository.)
